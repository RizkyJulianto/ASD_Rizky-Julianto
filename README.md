# Scanner Java 
This repository is the code when I practiced algorithms & data structures using the java programming language




## Lessons
Scanner is a class contained in the java.util package. This class functions as a tool to take input from the user, usually from the keyboard. Imagine Scanner as a tool that is ready to receive data that we type in the terminal or console, then convert it into a data format that we can process in our program.
